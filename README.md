### What is this repository for? ###

This is a set of experiments I have done in preparation for my accessibility system based on these methods (found in https://bitbucket.org/adam-barnett/blink_accessibility_project ).  

Each folder is a specific area which I've explored and many of them have contributed directly to the accessibility project.  Specifically their purposes are:
